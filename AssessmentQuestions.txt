1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
You can see iin github, this assignment took about 8 hours.

2.	What online resources you have used? 
I used your lectures, things seemed to suddenly click today! That was until I reached Problem #3. That one I don't feel confident about.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems?
No

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? 
No, I didn't get to start the assignment until today.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each quesiton.
I felt the first two questions were well covered, especially after today's lecture. Question 3 threw me. I'd like a review of that if it's something we'll come acros again.
